# Peregine-bot



This Discord bot patrols the channels in your Discord and scrapes URLs out of messages. It will do it's best to avoid interupting the flow of conversation, and a whitelist will be developed to support common known good links. As of now, it takes any link found in a chat message and submits it to Hybrid-Analysis. This is a first draft and is not ready for full release!
